# IT-Ticketing-System-Lab
This project documents a simulation of IT help desk workflows using the **Spiceworks Help Desk** ticketing system. The lab focuses on ticket creation, troubleshooting, documentation, and escalation practices.

## Environment Setup

I used the **Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk** for this lab.  
No local VM or server installation was required, since the platform runs in a web browser.

## Ticketing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Slow Website Performance

1. Created a ticket with the following description:
Every website that I open is slow. I have restarted my computer and deleted all running tabs.
I am available for troubleshooting during normal work hours.
My email is 1234@gmail.com and my cell phone number is 111-111-1111.


2. Troubleshooting steps:
- Reviewed the system’s background activity.
- Identified a resource-heavy application consuming system resources.
- Closed the application and confirmed that website performance returned to normal.

3. Documentation:
- **User Note:** “Hello, your computer had an application running in the background that was using a lot of system resources. Once that application was closed, the websites returned to normal speed.”  
- **Internal Note:** “Resource-heavy application seems to be running in the background on several workstations.”

### Scenario 2: Database Access Request

1. Created a ticket with the following description:
I need view-only access to the database but I need access for this action.

2. Troubleshooting steps:
- Verified that database permissions could not be modified at the help desk level.

3. Documentation:
- Escalated the ticket to the **Database Admin team**, since only they could grant access.

## Summary

- Created and resolved simulated IT support tickets in Spiceworks.  
- Practiced identifying performance issues and documenting resolutions.  
- Escalated a database access request to the appropriate admin team.  

This lab demonstrates how IT help desk ticketing systems are used to handle common workplace issues, document findings, and collaborate across teams.
